# Objects contating data

## Objects with results measurements
x_train: tidy table, where every observation is one measurement and every variable is some feature of measurement;
              it was used as training data set in machine learning process.
x_test: tidy table, where every observation is one measurement and every variable is some feature of measurement;
              it was used as testing data set in machine learning process.
              
## Objects with measurmant characteristics
y_train: activity labels for mesurements from 'x_train'
y_test: activity labels for mesurements from 'x_test'
subject_train: SUbject's ID for measurments from 'x_train'
subject_test: SUbject's ID for measurments from 'x_test'

## Objects for decoding
activity_labesl: codes for names of activities
features: names of variebles of measurements

#Variables
All variable names are in 'featers'
